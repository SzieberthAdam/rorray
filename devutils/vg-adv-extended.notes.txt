4.01.2 ASSIGNING NEUTRALS It seems sensible to make Plutocrat Temporary Rome
Consul tie-breaker the lower family ID value.

4.01.2 ASSIGNING NEUTRALS How would you handle tie-breaks? I feel it significant
because Conservatives get 2 extra cards, while Populists got one. Plutocrats &
Populists can easily have the same total Influence after the normal deal which
will end up Populists with higher value thanks to the extra senator. To counter
this, it would make sense to pick Plutocrats as the "stronger" faction from the
two which are tied. Stronger, especially in the early republic is the one with
better commanders but Populists avoid those offices as best as they can so they
seem the least militant faction.

Imperials tie-break would be less Influence to let most influence to the
Plutocrats, but if that would go to the Populists (as per my prev post), then
rather not.

Conservatives should be the weakest.

Thus, I would go for this (h: highest, l: lowest):
* 1. Imperials: hM hI hL hO
* 2. Plutocrats: hI hM hO hL
* 3. Conservatives: lI lM lO lL
* 4. Populists: (irrelevant, but) hO hI hL hM
